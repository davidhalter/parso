++++++++++++++++++

- Various small bugfixes

0.8.0 (2020-08-05)
++++++++++++++++++

- Dropped Support for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5
- It's possible to use ``pathlib.Path`` objects now in the API

- ``namedexpr_test`` nodes are now a proper class called ``NamedExpr``

0.7.1 (2020-07-24)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed a couple of smaller bugs (mostly syntax error detection in
  ``Grammar.iter_errors``)

This is going to be the last release that supports Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.

0.7.0 (2020-04-13)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fix a lot of annoying bugs in the diff parser. The fuzzer did not find
  issues anymore even after running it for more than 24 hours (500k tests).
- Small grammar change: suites can now contain newlines even after a newline.
  This should really not matter if you don't use error recovery. It allows for
  nicer error recovery.
